## Proposing or requesting a talk

We're using issues to provide some structure to requesting or proposing a talk.

Proposals and requests describe talk ideas suggested by a speaker, and talk ideas suggested but without a speaker.

**To propose or request a talk, create an issue and tag it with `talk` and `proposal` or `request`.**

Talk requests tagged `starter speaker` are talk ideas that can probably be tackled by someone wanting to do their first CocoaHeads talk.
